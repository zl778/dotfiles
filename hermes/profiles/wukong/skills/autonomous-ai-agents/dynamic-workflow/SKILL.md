when_to_use:
  - A task is too big for one context window AND you can describe the split (per-file, per-endpoint, per-source, per-record)
  - You want orchestration codified as a re-runnable script, not improvised turn-by-turn
  - Quality matters more than token economy: you want independent attempts cross-checked / refuted before you trust the answer
  - Codebase-wide bug/security sweep, 100+ file migration, multi-angle research with sources cross-checked
when_not_to_use:
  - Small bounded task (<~10 units) — just call the tool directly or do it inline
  - Tight serial dependency (B needs A's output) — orchestration overhead is wasted
  - You need it to survive the user sending a new message — see "The synchronous trap" below; use cron/kanban instead

# Dynamic Workflow — plan-in-code fan-out with verification

This is Hermes's answer to Claude Code's "dynamic workflows" (run hundreds of
parallel subagents in one session). The mechanic worth copying is NOT "more
subagents" — it is **moving the plan, the loop, and the intermediate results
OUT of the context window and INTO a script.** Normally the agent IS the
orchestrator: every intermediate result piles into context, which is exactly
what caps you at a handful of agents. A workflow keeps only the *final verified
answer* in context; the script holds everything else.

## The two orchestration-script layers (pick the right one — they are NOT interchangeable)

Hermes has no JS runtime. The "orchestration script" is one of two layers, and
the split is enforced by a real capability boundary, not a style preference:

| | Layer A: `execute_code` (Python script) | Layer B: `delegate_task` batch |
|---|---|---|
| Use for | DETERMINISTIC fan-out — fetch N URLs, parse N files, run N shell commands, template N outputs | LLM-JUDGMENT fan-out — classify, review, decide, write, refute, audit per item |
| The script holds | the loop + branching + intermediate vars (real Python) | n/a — you call it once with a `tasks=[...]` array; each task is its own isolated agent |
| Tools available inside | `web_search, web_extract, read_file, write_file, search_files, terminal, patch` ONLY (the `SANDBOX_ALLOWED_TOOLS` set) | configured child toolsets, subject to delegate restrictions (leaf children are stripped of `delegate_task`, `clarify`, `memory`, `send_message`, `execute_code` — see `DELEGATE_BLOCKED_TOOLS`) |
| Can it call `delegate_task`? | **NO.** `delegate_task` is NOT in `SANDBOX_ALLOWED_TOOLS`. Do not write a script that imports it — it will fail. | itself, if `role='orchestrator'` and `max_spawn_depth>=2` |
| Concurrency | you control it in Python (`ThreadPoolExecutor`, batches) | `delegation.max_concurrent_children` (default 3; raise in config.yaml) |
| Cost shape | cheap — most steps are tool calls, no per-item LLM unless you call `web_search`/aux | one model call tree PER child task — multiplies linearly, can be very expensive |

**Rule of thumb:** do the deterministic part in Layer A first (inline, in a
script), then fan out ONLY the irreducibly-LLM step via Layer B. This is
Pattern 1 from `delegate-task-output-patterns`, applied at workflow scale.
Mixing them: a Layer-A script can write a manifest file, and you (the parent)
then read that manifest and issue a single Layer-B `delegate_task` batch.

## The synchronous trap (READ THIS — it is the #1 way a "workflow" disappoints)

`delegate_task` runs **synchronously inside the parent turn**. If the user sends
a new message, hits /stop, or /new, every in-flight child is **cancelled and its
work discarded** (status `interrupted`). It does NOT run in the background, and
it does NOT survive the turn. There is no cache-resume of a half-finished fan-out.

So a "workflow" in Hermes is one of:

1. **Foreground workflow (default):** Layer A and/or one Layer-B batch, completed
   within a single turn. Good for minutes-long fan-out (dozens of units). The
   user waits. This is what you build 90% of the time.
2. **Durable workflow (hours/days, survives interruption):** use the **kanban
   swarm** (the SQLite-backed multi-agent kernel that ships with Hermes —
   `hermes_cli/kanban_swarm.py` + the kanban plugin; if your install has a
   `kanban-multiagent` skill, load it for the workflow). It
   writes a task graph (root → parallel workers → verifier → synthesizer) into
   the SQLite kanban kernel with a JSON blackboard. State persists across turns
   and restarts. This is the ONLY path that matches Claude Code's "runs into
   hours and days, resumes where it left off." Reach for it when the foreground
   path would time out or when the user must be able to walk away.

Never promise "background, resumable, hundreds of agents over days" from a plain
`delegate_task` call. For a durable multi-agent workflow *graph*, the kanban
swarm is the right fit. For simpler durable/out-of-turn cases there are lighter
options too: a `cronjob` one-shot or scheduled job, or a managed
`terminal(background=True, notify_on_complete=True)` process — both survive the
turn without standing up a full task graph.

## Workflow recipe (foreground)

1. **Decompose into independent units.** What is the unit — a file? an endpoint?
   a source? a record? Each unit must be answerable WITHOUT the others' output
   (else it's serial, not fan-out — see when_not_to_use).
2. **Deterministic pre-pass (Layer A).** In one `execute_code` script, gather the
   manifest: list the files, extract the candidate sites, fetch the raw sources,
   compute anything regex/parse can compute. Write a manifest to a **unique
   per-run** directory — `/tmp/wf_<name>_<uuid>/manifest.jsonl` (one unit per
   line), never a bare `/tmp/wf_<name>/` that a prior interrupted run could have
   left stale outputs in. This is the "plan in code." Print the unit count and
   the run dir, and stop.
3. **Size the fan-out** against `delegate-task-output-patterns`: chunk so each
   child handles ~8-12 mechanical file edits OR ~2000-3000 lines of reading OR
   ~50-70KB of corpus. Look at the LARGEST unit, not the average. One
   `delegate_task(tasks=[...])` call is bounded by
   `delegation.max_concurrent_children` (default 3) — it does NOT queue hundreds
   of tasks internally. For larger fan-out, issue bounded waves yourself (loop:
   one batch, collect, next batch) or have the user raise the config
   intentionally.
4. **LLM-judgment fan-out (Layer B).** Issue ONE `delegate_task` with a `tasks=[]`
   array, one task per chunk. Each task: reads its slice from the manifest,
   emits delimiter-separated lines to `/tmp/wf_<name>_<uuid>/out_<i>.csv`, prints a
   status word, stops. Do NOT depend on the `summary` field for content.
5. **Synthesize on the parent.** Read the out_*.csv files yourself — verify the
   file count and freshness (each was written this run) so a stale or missing
   output from an interrupted child isn't silently read as success — then merge
   and present. The cross-cutting "whole picture" step stays on the parent — only
   the per-unit work fanned out.

## The novel mechanic worth building: adversarial convergence

This is the part Hermes did NOT already have and the real reason to bother.
Claude Code's quality claim ("independent agents try to refute each other's
findings; only surviving claims surface; iterate until they converge") maps
cleanly onto `delegate_task` batch mode:

### Recipe: N independent attempts + M refuters

For a finding-quality task (security audit, "is this code path actually
vulnerable?", "does this migration preserve behavior?", a high-stakes plan):

1. **Independent attempts (round 1).** Fan out the SAME question to N children
   (N=2-4) with DIFFERENT framings/angles in each `context`, so they don't
   collapse to the same reasoning. Each writes its claims to
   `/tmp/wf_<name>/attempt_<i>.md` as a list of discrete, individually-checkable
   claims (one claim per line — atomicity is what makes refutation possible).
2. **Collect + dedupe (parent or Layer A).** Merge all claims into a single
   numbered list. Identical claims from independent attempts = higher prior;
   note the agreement count per claim.
3. **Refutation round (round 2).** Fan out a refuter batch: each refuter gets the
   claim list and is told "your job is to BREAK these claims — for each, find the
   counter-evidence (the auth check that DOES exist, the test that DOES cover it,
   the edge case the claim ignores). Output `claim_idx|survives|counter_evidence`."
   Give refuters the codebase/sources, not the original attempts' reasoning.
4. **Keep only survivors.** A claim surfaces to the user only if it survived
   refutation (no refuter produced valid counter-evidence). Filtered claims are
   dropped, with a one-line note of why if the user asked for completeness.
5. **Converge (optional).** If round 2 surfaced NEW claims (refuters often find
   adjacent issues), feed them back through one more refutation round. Stop when
   a round produces no new surviving claims — that's convergence. Cap at 3 rounds
   to bound cost.

This gives you the "more trustworthy than a single pass" property without a
runtime — it's just two `delegate_task` batches and a merge, structured so
disagreement is visible and unsupported claims die before they reach the user.

### Why atomic claims matter
A refuter cannot break "the auth layer has problems." It CAN break "endpoint
`POST /api/users/:id/role` in src/routes/users.ts:142 has no role check." Force
attempts to emit specific, located, individually-falsifiable claims or the
refutation round is theater.

## Cost discipline (this is the thing that bites)

A workflow can consume dramatically more tokens than a normal turn — that is
inherent, not a bug. Two real multipliers:

- **Each Layer-B child is a full agent tree.** 20 children ≈ 20× the model calls.
  `delegation.max_concurrent_children` only bounds *concurrency*, not *total*.
- **Hermes aux/subagent model defaults to main-model-first.** Children inherit
  the parent's (often expensive reasoning) model. `delegate_task` does NOT expose
  a per-task `model` or `profile` field — its per-task keys are
  `{goal, context, toolsets, role}`. To run the fan-out cheaper you either route
  delegation globally via `delegation` config (model/provider applied to all
  children), or — for genuinely model/profile-scoped work — use cron, the kanban
  swarm, or a separate Hermes process. The cleanest lever for mechanical fan-out
  is still Layer A: do the deterministic part in a script with no per-item LLM at
  all.

Always: start on a SCOPED slice (one directory, 20 records, 10 endpoints), prove
the recipe end-to-end, report the token cost, THEN offer to run it at full scale.
Never silently fan out hundreds of children — surface the cost first and let the
user say go.

## Pitfalls

- **Writing `delegate_task` inside an `execute_code` script.** It's not in
  `SANDBOX_ALLOWED_TOOLS`; the import/stub won't exist. Layer A is deterministic
  tools only. Fan out LLM judgment from the parent turn, not from inside a script.
- **Promising background/resumable from `delegate_task`.** It's synchronous and
  turn-scoped. Durable = kanban swarm.
- **Trusting `summary` fields for content.** Route structured output to files
  (Pattern 2 in delegate-task-output-patterns).
- **Non-atomic claims in the verify recipe.** Unfalsifiable claims survive
  refutation by default and pollute the output. Force located, specific claims.
- **Same framing in all "independent" attempts.** They collapse to one answer and
  the cross-check is worthless. Vary the angle in each child's context.
- **Fanning out a serial task.** If unit B needs unit A's output, parallelism
  produces wrong/empty results. Re-check independence before fanning out.

## Verification before you call it done

- Did the deterministic pre-pass actually run, and does the manifest line-count
  match the expected unit count? (`wc -l /tmp/wf_<name>/manifest.jsonl`)
- Did every fan-out child write its output file? (`ls /tmp/wf_<name>/out_*.csv`) —
  remember stalled children often completed anyway (Pattern 6).
- For the verify recipe: can you point to the refuter counter-evidence for every
  DROPPED claim, and confirm every SURFACED claim went through refutation?
- Did you report token cost on the scoped run before offering full scale?
